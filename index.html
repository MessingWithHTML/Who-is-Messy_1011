		<h3 style="color:white;">These days, the need for programmers
		has increased a lot, (When I say a lot, it means A LOT) due to the technological
		advancements made by man. With inventions like AI, Robots etc. at such a rate, 
		we will most likely face a disaster, and that is: LESS PROGRAMMERS!</h3>

		<h3 style="color:white;">I am Messy_1011 (Real name is Shlok) an 11 year old boy
		from India. I found that I had an intrest in this thing called 'Programming' during 
		the COVID peirod. My intrest gradually increased and I decieded to learn 					it. But which language? After a lot of thinking and arguing (with myself)
		I decided to learn HTML.</h3>

		<h3 style="color:white;">So yeah, there's that. I have been coding for like: 4
		years now and It proved kinda fruitful so try it too!</h3>

		<h3 style="color:white;">Well, even though I am learning HTML, I am not planning
		 to make it my carrier. I am right now planning to be a proffesional footballer or
		an astronomer. The main reason for that is: I just don't want to be a programmer
		by proffesion, I want it to remain as a hobby and let me chase my dreams.</h3>

		<h3 style="color:white;">That was all for my quick introdution my friends!
		Until next time! Bye Guys!</h3>
