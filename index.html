		<h3 style="color:white;">These days, the need for programmers
		has increased a lot, (When I say a lot, it means A LOT) due to the technological
		advancements made by man. With inventions like AI, Robots etc. at such a rate, 
		we will most likely face a disaster, and that is: LESS PROGRAMMERS!</h3>

		<h3 style="color:white;">I am Messy_1011 (Real name is Shlok) an 11 year old boy
		from India. I found that I had an intrest in this thing called 'Programming' during
